Abstract

   This memo defines the Coinche protocol Discussion and suggestions for
   improvement are requested.  The Coinche protocol has been developped
   over the last a week at Epitech Nantes by the "C'etait pas .net
   client ?" team.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

   The protocol is a binary-based protocol, with the simplest client
   being any socket program capable of discussing with the servers via a
   socket.

1.  Introduction

   The original specification of the Coinche.

1.1.  A protocol

   Data transfered through socket is binary data.  It corresponds to a
   Message object that is serialized via Protobuf.net library.  A
   Message corresponds to an operation required by the client to the
   server en vice-versa.  Thereby, a Message can be type and such can be
   a CHAT, a CONNECT, a LIST, a PLAYER_PLAY, an AI_PLAY, a, PUTTED or an
   INVENTORY message.  A message is constructed as this :

      CoincheHeader : type of message

      SourceIdentifier : emitter id

      SourceName : emitter name

      MessageContent : message content

      MessageIndex : numbering

      RelayCount : counting broadcast

1.2.  servers

   The servers forms the backbone of Coinche, providing a point to which
   clients may connect to to play.  An account is required to launch a
   server.

1.3.  clients

   A client is anything connecting to a server that is not another
   server.  Each client is distinguished from other clients by a unique
   id : the source identifier.  Clients between themselves thanks to the
   below Spider protocol definition and especially via the CHAT message
   which allows them to chat.

2.  Message and derivates

   The protocol as described herein is for use with both client to
   client and client to server connections.  Message that are now
   properly typed MUST be dropped.

2.1.  CHAT

   A chat message : its content is displayed to the client/server

2.2.  CONNECT

   A connect event : the contents contains the name of the player that
   want to connect to the server

2.3.  LIST

   A player listing event : client wants to fetch the players list on
   the server.  It is return as follows :

      [ empty ]

      [ ange ]

      [ belial, cthulu ]

2.4.  PLAYER_PLAY

   Game init event : a client is ready to play with others
